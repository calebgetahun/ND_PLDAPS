function p = RGBcalibration_taskdef(p)
% define task parameters for the joystick training task.
% This function will be executed at every trial start, hence it is possible
% to edit it while the experiment is in progress in order to apply online
% modifications of the task.
%
% TODO: - Make sure that changed parameters are kept in the data file, i.e.
%         that there is some log when changes happened
%       - read in only changes in order to allow quicker manipulations via the
%         keyboard without overwriting it every time by calling this routine
