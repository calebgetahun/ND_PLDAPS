function rV = ND_RandSample(V, N, mx)
% ND_RandSample - sample with replacement but maximize unique events
%
% DESCRIPTION 
%   Create a vector with <N> random samples from 
% 
% SYNTAX 
% Ovec = ND_HalfSpace(From, To, Nele)
%
%   Input:
%         <From>  Start value of the vector, has the shortest distance to the
%                 next value
%
%         <To>    End value of the vector, has the longest distance to the
%                 previous value
%        
%         <Nele>  Number of elements, length of output vector
